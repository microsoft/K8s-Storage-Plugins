# Flexvolume Kubernetes Plugins
Here are implementations of flexvolume in kubernetes for iSCSI and SMB. Also helps serve as a scaffolding for building future volume plugins in powershell on Windows.

For more info on Flexvolume see
 * https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/flexvolume.md
 * https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_flex_volume.html#flex-volume-drivers-without-master-initiated-attach-detach

Supported on version Kubernetes v1.9.9 or higher

Go to https://github.com/Microsoft/K8s-Storage-Plugins/releases/latest and download the latest flexvolume-windows.zip.

Extract into kubernetes volume plugin location on all Windows nodes, the default path is C:\usr\libexec\kubernetes\kubelet-plugins\volume\exec\ (in case of AKS path is C:\k\volumeplugins)


## Deployment guide (source)
The default plugin folder location in a Windows kubernetes worker node is C:\usr\libexec\kubernetes\kubelet-plugins\volume\exec\ (in case of AKS path is C:\k\volumeplugins)
* SMB
    * Copy plugins/microsoft.com~smb.cmd into the plugin folder
* ISCSI
    * Copy plugins/microsoft.com~iscsi.cmd into the plugin folder
    * Build utils/iscsiHelper
        * If you do not have Visual Studio & Windows SDK see [vs_build](vs_build/)
        * copy produced iscsiHelper.exe into plugin folder/microsoft.com~iscsi.cmd/
    * Optionally create a pr.txt file in the current working directory that corresponds to that node's SCSI PR to use
        * If none is created a random one will be generated

See https://github.com/andyzhangx/Demo/tree/master/windows/flexvolume for more info.

To get logs for the plugin run `Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source Kube* -Newest 50  | %{$_.message}`

 ## Plugins
 See [sample_yamls](sample_yamls) for information how to write Persistent Volumes.
* SMB
    * This plugin allows you to use SMB shares. 
    * **Currently there is no storage fencing**
        * The application must hold locks on the files they use
    * readOnly in flexVolume is ignored 
        * to get readOnly behavior, specify volumeMounts when consuming volume
            * readOnly: true

* iSCSI
    * Plugin allows you to consume iSCSI disks.
    * Provides fencing through the use of SCSI Persistent Reservations

## Folder structure
* plugins/microsoft.com~iscsi.cmd
    * All powershell files needed for iscsi plugin
    * When deploying must add iscsiHelper.exe
* plugins/microsoft.com~smb.cmd
    * All files for smb plugin
* sample_yamls
    * some yamls that demonstrate howto use the plugins
* utils/scriptrunner
    * Serves as a basis for building plugins
    * These files are symlinked into plugin directories
* utils/iscsiHelper
    * Contains a c++ commandline application that provides some storage features used by iscsi.cmd
* vs_build
    * Setup a container with Visual Studio 2017 & SDK to build iscsiHelper.exe
        * This is optional, and just provided for ease of use.
        * **Beware the produced image file is quite large 25+GB.**
